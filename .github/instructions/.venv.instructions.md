## Virtual Environment Usage
This repository must always use the `.venv` virtual environment for all notebooks and scripts. Follow these guidelines:

- **Always activate the .venv environment** before running any Python scripts or notebooks.
- **Configure notebooks** to use the Python kernel from `.venv` (typically `.venv/bin/python` or `.venv/Scripts/python` on Windows).
- **Run scripts** using the Python executable from `.venv`, e.g., `.venv/bin/python script.py`.
- **Install packages** into `.venv` using pip from the activated environment.
- **Never use system Python** or other virtual environments for this project.
- **Document environment setup** in README or setup instructions, ensuring .venv is created and activated.

This ensures consistent dependencies and prevents conflicts with system packages.
